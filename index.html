		<h1>Welcome</h1>
		<p>
			This is my submission for my CSCI 5611 class's Project 3.
			My name is Nate Meshesha, and I did not have a partner for this project.
			The goal of this project was to get a working inverse kinematics system.
			I chose to implement a soccer themed scene using ThreeJS.
			There is a moveable stick figure which acts as a goalie protecting a soccer goal.
			The goalie is able to use the IK system I have written to move their arms to follow where the user's mouse moves along a 2D plane representing the goal.
			Although the rendering is in 3D, due to time constraints I chose to implement the actual inverse kinematics techniques using 2D.

		<h2>Explanation of Files</h2>
		<p>
			All the code for the Inverse Kinematics simulation is stored in the directory: ./src .
			The ik.js file contains the code running simulation, and it can be thought of as the main script for the simulation.
			The IKScene.js file contains the ThreeJS scene and environment, and all the functionality to add and remove objects to the scene.
			The skeleton.js file contains the skeleton class which represents the person/goalie in the scene.
			This is where the functionality to move the character, and the position of the root is stored.
			The skeleton class also contains two instances of the arm class which is defined in the arm.js file. 
			The Arm class represents a list of joints, lengths, and angles that make up the IK system.
			The code containing the IK Solving algorithms is stored in the arm.js file.
		</p>
		<p>	
		<br />
			The external library files I used are: three.module.js, OrbitalControls.js, GLTFLoader.js, stats.js, and dat.gui.module.js. 
		</p>

		<h2>Running Locally/Explanation of Files</h2>
		<p>
			If you want to run the code locally there are a few dependencies needed:
			<ul>
				<li>NPM (node package manager used to install dependencies)</li>
				<li>NPX (used to run server and usually comes install with NPM I believe)</li>
				<li>http-server (an NPM package used to serve the static files containing the app)</li>
			</ul>
			After installing npm you can run <b>"npm install http-server"</b> to install the http-server package.
			Then by running the command <b>"npx http-server"</b> it should start a simple http server.
			After doing this you should be able to go to http://127.0.0.1:8080 to view the application.

		<h2> Features Implemented </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3>Single-arm IK (at least 2D)</h3>
				<p>
						<b>Feature Description: </b>
					<i>	Produce an animation where a skeleton of at least 4 joints and at least one end 
						effector reaches to touch an object.  The skeleton must have a root that does not 
						move. You must show at least one successful animation, and one animation of what 
						happens when the object is out of reach. 
					</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>See feature below.</b>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Multi-arm IK (at least 2D)</h3>
				<p>
						<b>Feature Description: </b>
					<i>	Produce an animation where a skeleton, of at least 8 joints and at least two end 
						effectors, reaches to touch an object. The skeleton must have a central root between 
						the two arms that does not move.  Both end effectors must be able to move and 
						touch an object. You must show at least one successful animation for each arm, and 
						one animation of what happens when the object is out of reach both arms. [This will 
						also count as single-arm IK meaning multi-arm IK totals up to 40 points.] 
					</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					The skeleton I have created has two arms with 4 joints, and therefore, 8 joints in total.
					Each arm has its own end effector, and they are both trying to reach the same goal which is represented as the projection of the mouse position on the 2D plane representing the soccer goal.
					This is done by shooting a ray from the mouse position and colliding with a slightly transparent box object in the scene.
					Both arms share the same root node located at the torso of the skeleton.
					I chose to use the CCD and FABRIK algorithms to implement my IK on the 2D plane, since I didn't have time to fully implement 3D IK.
					I didn't get to implement joint constraints for the FABRIK method, so it appears to only show one arm.
					There actually are 2 arms in both methods, but since there is no joint constrains for FABRIK, both arms result in the exact same calculations.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Joint limits</h3>
				<p>
						<b>Feature Description: </b>
					<i>	Add angle and/or rotational speed limits to some or all of the skeleton joints. 
						Include in your report a video showing the difference in motion with and without 
						these limits. For full point, be sure to choose limits that increase how natural the 
						resulting animations look. 				 
					</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					I implemented angle limits to the CCD method of IK solving.
					I tried to give limits to both arms that looked somewhat realistic, and this required some trial and error.
					Unfortunately, I was unable to get joint limits in FABRIK working.
					Therefore, it appears to only show one arm since both arms are resulting in the exact same calculations.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>User Interaction</h3>
				<p>
						<b>Feature Description: </b>
					<i>	These points come from allowing the user to interact directly with the simulation 
						itself (not from controlling the camera). To get full points, the user should have a 
						clear, smooth, and natural way to interact with the animation. Discrete interactions 
						such as toggling some behavior on/off will only receive a couple of points. For full 
						credit, support continuous interaction such as allowing the user to use their mouse 
						move an obstacle or to control where the IK system is trying to reach. 
					</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					The user is able to move the skeleton to the left and right by pressing on their keyboard.
					Internally, the root node is being moved, while all other elements are updated based on the new root position.
					Additionally the user is able to jump by pressing w, which moves the root in a similar fashion.
					Lastly, the user is able to move their mouse on the 2D plane representing the soccer goal to move the goal node used by the IK system.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Moving IK (at least 2D)</h3>
				<p>
						<b>Feature Description: </b>
					<i>	
						Allow the skeleton to move its root in a natural looking fashion that interacts 
						smoothly with the IK-based animation. 
					</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					As mentioned in the feature above, the user is able to move the skeleton left, right, and jump. 
					The IK system responds to new the position of the root, and updates the joints accordingly.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>3D Simulation & Rendering</h3>
				<p>
						<b>Feature Description: </b>
					<i>	
						Simulate and render your IK system in a 3D environment.
						For full credit, the 3D nature of the motion needs to be clear in the resulting animation though the use of dynamic cameras, 3D lighting, etc. 
					</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					I used ThreeJS to render the environment along with the skeleton and it's arms.
					There is both a hemisphere and directional light used to light up the scene.
					Additionally, I have added in a grass texture, and soccer goal model to give better context to the scene.
					All calculations done for inverse kinematics are based on the 2D plane represented by the x and y axis. 
					Therefore, as it is not full 3D IK I understand that I may not get the full points for this feature.
					I wasn't sure if what I'd done was worth any partial points, so I have listed it here anyways.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Challenge - Comparative Analysis : Alternative IK Solver</h3>
				<p>
					<b>Feature Description: </b>
					<i>
						Implement a second IK solving technique beyond the one used in your above 
						simulations. Include in your webpage some analysis comparing the two methods. 
						Which was easier to implement? Which performed better? Which is more flexible? 
						Do both methods support constraints equally well? Etc. 
						 
						Some reasonable solvers to consider are: CCD, FABRIK, Gradient decent, Basic 
						random search, or RRT (the configuration space is the joint angles). Feel free to 
						research and implement other methods. 
					</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					The other IK solving technique I chose to implement was FABRIK.
					After taking some time to understand FABRIK using the resources provided in class, I thought it was simpler to implement than CCD.
					Both were relatively easy to implement, but it was nice to not worry much about angles in the FABRIK implementations.
					Also, when comparing both, I found that FABRIK performed better as CCD would sometimes get stuck in some awkward configurations if no joint limits were applied.
					Unfortunately, I was unable to get constraints working with FABRIK in time.
					This is one area in which CCD was much more flexible.
					Since CCD directly involves manipulating the joint angles, it was pretty simple to incorporate joint angle limits.
					For the FABRIK method, this was more complicated to both understand and get working than CCD.

		<h2> List of Tools/Libraries Used </h2>
		<p>
			I thought it'd be cool to have a working simulation all within the browser so that it can be easily accessible for anyone to view and play with.
			Therefore, I chose to do project 3 using ThreeJS.
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h3>Rendering</h3>
					<p>For rendering the 3D scene, the ThreeJS library was used. </p> 
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>GUI</h3>
					<p>The Dat.GUI library was used to create the parameters GUI for editing the parameters of the simulation. </p> 
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Performance Statistics</h3>
					<p> To Calculate the frames per second and various other performance statistics, the Stats.Js library was used. These statistics can be scene in the top left of the screen. </p> 
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Local Server for Development/Testing</h3>
					<p>
						In order to run and test ThreeJS locally, it needs to be served by an http server.
						I chose to use NodeJS to both download the source code for the various libraries and create a simple http server to run the app locally.
						Usually, you would want to use a module bundler like webpack to bundle the source code, but to simplify the development process, I made it so the app runs as is from the root directory.
						I made some minor edits in the source code for the various libraries I used, and I then moved them to the root directory.
						These include three.module.js, dat.gui.module.js, OrbitControls.js, and stats.js. 
						To run the code locally, the http-server needs to be install first.
						Then running npx http-server should start a server that serves all the files in the root directory.

		<h2> Difficulties During Development </h2>
		<h3>IK Difficulties</h3>
		<p>
			The main difficulties I faced were errors when attempting to implement the IK solver. 
			Since I used ThreeJS for the previous two projects, I had a much better time setting up the environment and boilerplate code.
			When trying to implement the CCD IK solver I was running into many issues at first with getting single arm IK working.
			I had misunderstood part of the algorithm related to creating a vector to the goal from the current joint.
			Therefore my joints and angles were not being properly calculated, and this took me a while to understand.
			Once I was able to get single arm working, it was easy to create a multi-arm with the way I had defined the arm class.
			As mentioned in the Challenge feature description above, I had difficulties with my FABRIK implementation.
			It took a bit of time to understand the algorithm itself, and after I was able to implement it, I couldn't understand how best to implement joint constraints.
			I had initially thought to try to calculate the joint angle during each step and only allow the updating of joint position if it was less than a specific constraint value.
			I wasn't able to come up with what to do if the updated joint position was outside of the range allowed by the joint angle constraint.
		</p>
		<h3>Ideas For Future Work</h3>
		<p>
			If I had a bit more time I would've tried to work out the math to get the joint angle constraints working for the FABRIK method.
			Additionally, I had wanted to add an IK system for the legs of the skeleton for realistic walking motions when being moved by the user.
			Lastly, if I had more time I would try to implement true 3D IK.
